## React Movie App Firebase Authentication With MUI

My purpose in making this project is to use the power of React Hooks on the page by using multiple methods. I imported the images in the Asset folder directly to the page and replaced the images on the pages that could not be found. With Firebase Authentication, I restricted access to the page without user login. With the redux structure, it was possible to access the firebase functions from each component and I provided the page transitions with the routers. I have completely fulfilled the Single page Application features. I used Material UI for sytling, I can say that MUI's Card, Appbar, Grid, Typography Components are the most used components for this page. I tried to pay attention to every detail to make the page responsive.
